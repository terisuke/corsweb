    title: 'How does the development process proceed? What is the typical timeline for project completion?',
    answer:
      "During the development process, our engineers listen to the customer's requests online and define the necessary system and requirements. Additionally, within one week after the first meeting, we will calculate the price for each product and, after receiving your approval, we will begin creating the price.We do not have any subcontractors, and because we are responsible for creating all projects in-house, we are able to produce products approximately 20% faster than normal delivery times on average. In addition, for large projects, we assign freelance engineers who can empathize with the project, so we can provide products more quickly and at lower costs.",
  },

    id: 'faq-2',
    title: 'How is the project cost calculated? How is payment made?',
    answer:
      'Regarding pricing, since each company has different requirements, we will send you a quote after the first meeting. We often make proposals at costs that are approximately 20% lower than similar projects in the same industry.We accept a variety of payment methods other than cash, such as bank transfers and Paypal payments. Please let our staff know your preferred payment method during your first meeting.',

    title: "What are the advantages of using React, Flutter and Python? What are the advantages of BaaS such as Firebase and SupaBase?",
    answer:
      'React, Flutter, and Python enable reusable UI components, cross-platform support, and high-performance app development. These languages ​​are flexible, easy to understand for beginners, and have extensive libraries. On the other hand, BaaS like Firebase and SupaBase offer real-time data synchronization, a variety of built-in features, scalability, transparency, and security. Combining these technologies enables efficient and high-quality application development.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-4',
    title: "How much can I customize it based on my specific requirements? How will you respond if changes are required?",
    answer:
      "Since we listen to the customer's wishes for each project and manufacture them to order, the possibilities for customization are virtually limitless. However, in order to speed up delivery and avoid fatal system errors, we do not accept changes to requirements during creation. We kindly ask that you thoroughly summarize your requests and meet them by the time of the first meeting.",
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-5',
    title: 'How will maintenance and support be provided after development? Are there any additional costs?',
    answer:
      'Since our main business is development, we do not provide maintenance or support other than major customization. After the development is complete, we will introduce you to a company that specializes in maintenance and support that we partner with, so please consult with them regarding costs.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-6',
    title: 'How is data security and privacy guaranteed?',
    answer:
      'For data security and privacy guarantees, we use advanced encryption techniques and take full advantage of BaaS security features such as Firebase and SupaBase. For access control, set up a dedicated account for each company and manage it with the minimum necessary privileges. We also keep your data safe through strict compliance with data protection policies and regular security audits. As a result, we have established a system to protect customer data across the board, from development to provision and maintenance.',
